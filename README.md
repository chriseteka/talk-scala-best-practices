Scala is a language with many qualities, but it has more than its share of quirks and small things that don't exactly behave as you'd expect.

This talk is about the more commons gotchas in the language, and the standard recipees we have for dealing with them. A lot of them are
assumed to be common knowledge and never really brought up, which means that a lot of Scala developers had to find out about them the hard
way.

The purpose of this talk is to try and save some pain by puting the worst offenders in the spotlight and, hopefully, starting conversations
around them.

Slides can be consulted directly on the [companion site](https://nrinaudo.github.io/talk-scala-best-practices/#1).

There's also a [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByyPqBoV3Vw) of me giving the talk (French only, I'm afraid).
